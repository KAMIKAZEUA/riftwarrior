# Rift Warrior (iOS)

**The source code for iOS game "Rift Warrior" (Yes, I'm the developer and product owner)** <br/>
The original game can be downloaded from the link: [Rift Warrior at AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id634847542). 
Unfortunately, it's not supported on iOS 11 since the released version was not built using the latest cocos2d-x and Xcode (it was built in early 2015). It's not an issue for iOS 11 if you build from the source code though. This is also the reason why I make it open source.<br/>
All account specific logic&data have been removed, such as In-App-Purchase, Google Ads, Social Network Sharing, and Flurry tracking. All others remain the same.

## Current Issues
* On my 2015 Mackbook Pro (8GB), it runs extremely slow on XCode 9 simulator (but runable), and may cause occational crash. On a 2015 iMac with 16G memory, everything seems fine. So try it yourself on a better dev machine.

## Build and Run in Xcode
Use the latest Xcode (tested with Xcode 9) and open:  **code/projects/riftwarrior/proj.ios/riftwarrior.xcodeproj**
