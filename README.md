**The source code for iOS game "Rift Warrior" (Yes, I'm the developer and product owner)** <br/>
The original game can be downloaded from the link: [Rift Warrior at AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id634847542)<br/>
The game was created in 2013 and stopped releasing in 2015. Now it might be fun to make it open source. <br/>
All account specific logic&data have been removed, such as In-App-Purchase, Google Ads, Social Network Sharing, and Flurry tracking. All others remain the same.

## Current Issues
* It runs extremely slow on XCode 9 simulator (but runable), and may cause occational crash. We suggest using your own Apple Developer account and try it on real device.

## Build and Run in Xcode
Use the latest Xcode (tested with Xcode 9) and open:  **code/projects/riftwarrior/proj.ios/riftwarrior.xcodeproj**
